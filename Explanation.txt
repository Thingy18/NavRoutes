I am have set this up so that the algorithm will calculate everything in units of 1 hour

I am going to add my algorithm on Friday

So far I have set up a text file so when the main method in the NavRoutes class is run
it will set up four islands and a route between every islands

Text me if you need anything

Since the sample size for testing is so small I am going to make it so each canoe can
only carry a quantity of 10 units of a single resource though this could be changed for 
a larger sample size and because it is not specifically said I am making the decision
that there is a infinite number of canoes on each island
