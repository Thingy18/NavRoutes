I am have set this up so that the algorithm will calculate everything in units of 1 hour

So far I have set up a text file so when the main method in the NavRoutes class is run
it will set up four islands and a route between every islands

Text me if you need anything

Since the sample size for testing is so small I am going to make it so each canoe can
only carry a quantity of 10 units of a single resource though this could be changed for 
a larger sample size and because it is not specifically said I am making the decision
that there is a infinite number of canoes on each island

I have finished my algorithm and will put below the basics reasoning for my choices
of data structure for the explanation 

When there is an array it is because it was never going to have more or less values but
the values would be looked at and modified without moving them

When I used a linked list it was because I was going to be iterating through it 

I used arraylists when creating the values I would send to other classes because they could
easily be changed into arrays which is what those classes usually had

The shortestPath class uses djikstras algorithm to create the shortest path from a starting
island to every other island
